####Specs:

* Ruby version: v2.3.x

* Rails version: v4.2.6?

###Running on Heroku
To push to the remoke heroku server, you need a heroku account
Then install: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line (heroku cli)

Then in the same repository folder as this one: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/collab

To push (to check if changes are heroku compatable (they probably are, hopefully) )
  1. git commit/add etc as per usual
  2. git push heroku master

If this doesn't work message me to add your email or I can just check in once in a while push changes and check if it works,
but it might be better if you test your changes too .__.
